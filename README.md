# AguilarLibrary
The program allows users to borrow a book by asking for the book title, the number of days they want the book, and the current date. The program will then generate the expected return date of the book by using AddDays and DateTime as well as the NumberOfDays variable. It will display "Invalid Input" if the user enters an incorrect format.
